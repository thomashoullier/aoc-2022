# Advent of Code 2022
Solving the Advent of Code (AOC) 2022 puzzles. This year in C++.

My goal is to learn some common C++ libraries used in solving
the type of problems in AOC. I tried using mostly modern C++.

My rules are:
* The solution should work for anyone's input.
* The program for any given day is self-standing.
* The program for any given day fits in one file.
* No peeking online for the solution to the specific AOC problem.

For future references, here are the days where I used notable concepts
or libraries:
* Regular expressions: days 5, 11
* Queues: day 6
* Graphs (with Boost Graph Library): day 7, 12
* Eigen: day 8
* Hashmap: day 9
